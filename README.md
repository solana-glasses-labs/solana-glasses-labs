##  What is Solana Glasses?

Solana Glasses is a wearable device that enables **hands-free, on-chain crypto transactions** through:

- Voice commands (e.g., “Pay 0.01 SOL to @cafeteria”)
- QR code scanning for real-world payments
- AI-powered assistant for on-chain navigation
- Audio-visual feedback

The goal is to make crypto payments *invisible*, *frictionless*, and *fun*—no wallet app, no screen needed.
